The Bukvycja plugin adds drop caps to your posts, pages and comments. It comes with some cool css styling and lots of options.

== Description ==

The Bukvycja plugin is fairly self-explanatory. It adds mark-up to your posts and pages which allows you to create drop caps.

The plugin now has loads of settings. You can choose which pages to put drop caps on. You can exclude specific posts and categories and you can also choose wether to use the default styling.

The plugin marks-up the first paragraph (or all paragraphs ) starting with a capital letter. It makes the first letter into a drop cap and gives the paragraph a class of "first-child" allowing you to style the first paragraph in a different way.
